stix2gui
--------
**This is a proof-of-concept project with no functionality. Do not use.**

This project attempts to build a graphical interface on top of the [STIX2 Python library](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-python-stix2) using [Eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel). Inspired by the Javascript-only [stix2viz](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-visualization).
